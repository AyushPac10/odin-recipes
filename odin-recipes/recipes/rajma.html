<strong>
Rajma the heartbeat of north india. <br>
Rajma is comfort food at its best. I like rajma best with simple jeera (cumin) rice. Of course, some roti would be great too. When I was in college, I ate rajma at least once a week. Cheap, nutritious, and comforting. What is not to like?</strong>

<li>Step 1</li>
<br><strong>Place the kidney beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse..</strong>

<br><strong>Grind the onion, ginger, and garlic into a paste using a mortar and pestle.</strong>
<li>Step 3</li>
<br><strong>Heat the oil and ghee together in a pressure cooker over medium heat. Fry the red chile peppers, cumin seeds, and whole cloves in the hot oil until the cumin seeds begin to splutter; stir the onion paste into the mixture and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Season with the ground turmeric, ground cumin, and ground coriander; continue cooking for a few more seconds before adding the tomatoes. Cook until the tomatoes are completely tender.</strong>
